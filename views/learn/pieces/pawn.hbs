          The pawn is the most numerous and low-value piece in chess, capable of advancing forward and capturing
          diagonally. It represents the backbone of a player's position and is essential for controlling the board.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pawn is most effective when it is supported by other pieces, creating a strong formation that can control
          key squares. Players must be mindful of pawn structure and potential weaknesses, as isolated or doubled
          pawns can become targets for attack.

          How It Moves

          The pawn moves forward one square, but captures diagonally. This unique movement allows it to control key
          squares and create threats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pawns can only move two squares forward on their first move, providing an opportunity for rapid advancement.
          However, this can also lead to overextension and vulnerability.

            A <span class="font-bold">passed pawn</span> is a pawn that has no opposing pawns blocking its path to
            promotion. This makes it a powerful asset in the endgame, as it can advance to the eighth rank and promote
            without obstruction.
          </p>
          <p>
            A passed pawn is most effective when supported by other pieces, as it can create multiple threats and
            distract the opponent's forces.

          <p>
            A <span class="font-bold">fork</span> is a tactic which involves attacking two undefended or higher valued
            pieces at the same time, forcing the opponent to make a tough decision.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pawns can fork pieces by advancing to a square where they attack two or more pieces simultaneously.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="space-y-4" data-tactic="pawnPyramid">
          <p>
            A <span class="font-bold">pawn pyramid</span> is a formation where pawns are stacked on top of each other
            to create a strong defensive structure. This setup can protect the pawns and control key squares on the
            board.
          </p>
          <p>
            By maintaining this structure, players can create a solid foundation for their pieces and limit the
            opponent's options.
