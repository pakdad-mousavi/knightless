          The bishop is a long-range piece that moves diagonally across the board. It is most effective when it can
          control key diagonals and exert pressure on the opponent's position. It can cover a lot of ground and create
          threats from a distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bishops are particularly powerful in open positions where their long-range movement allows them to control
          multiple squares and create threats against the opponent's pieces.

          How It Moves
        </h2>

          The bishop moves diagonally across the board, covering squares of the same color. It can move any number of
          squares in a straight line, making it a powerful piece for controlling long diagonals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bishops are limited to squares of the color they start on, meaning a light-squared bishop can only move on
          light squares, while a dark-squared bishop can only move on dark squares. This limitation can be both a
          strength and a weakness, depending on the position.

          Common Tactics

          <p>
            A <span class="font-bold">pin</span> is a tactic where a piece is attacked and cannot move without exposing
            a more valuable piece behind it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bishop pins are particularly effective against knights, as they cannot move to a square that would expose
            the pinned piece, such as the king or queen.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="space-y-4" data-tactic="skewers">
          <p>
            A <span class="font-bold">skewer</span> is a tactic where a more valuable piece is attacked, forcing it to
            move and exposing a less valuable piece behind it, like a reverse pin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Skewers are particularly effective against high-value pieces, such as the queen or rooks, as they are forced
            to move and expose less valuable, yet vulnerable pieces behind them.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="space-y-4" data-tactic="forks">
          <p>
            A <span class="font-bold">fork</span> is a tactic where a piece attacks two or more of the opponent's pieces
            simultaneously, creating a dilemma for the opponent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Forks are particularly effective against pieces that are unable to escape the attack, such as pinned pieces
            or those with limited mobility.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="space-y-4" data-tactic="batteries">
          <p>
            A <span class="font-bold">battery</span> is a formation where pieces are stacked on top of each other
            to create a strong offensive structure. This setup can protect the pieces and control key squares on the
            board.
          </p>
          <p>
            A bishop battery is often formed with the queen, allowing the bishop to control long diagonals while the
            queen supports it from behind, or vice versa.
