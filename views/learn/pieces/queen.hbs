          The queen is the most powerful piece on the board, combining the moves of both the rook and bishop. It can
          move any number of squares in a straight line, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
        </p>
        <p>
          The queen is most effective when it is active and centralized, where it can influence both sides of the board.
          Mastering the queen's movements and understanding its tactical potential is crucial for dominating the game
          and launching devastating attacks!

          The queen moves like both a rook and a bishop, allowing it to control both ranks and files as well as
          diagonals.
        </p>
        <p>
          The queen can move any number of squares in a straight line, but it cannot jump over other pieces. It is
          particularly powerful when placed on the same rank or file as another rook, forming a <span
            class="font-bold">battery</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The queen is also a key piece in endgames, where its ability to control open files and ranks can lead to
          decisive advantages.

          Common Tactics
        </h2>
        <hr class="w-4/5 mx-auto border-2 sm:w-full lg:w-4/5 border-oak sm:mx-0">
      </div>
      <div class="mb-8 text-lg text-center sm:text-left tactic-info-container">
        <div class="space-y-4 active-tactic-text" data-tactic="centralization">
          <p>
            <span class="font-bold">Queen centralization</span> involves placing the queen in a central position
            where it controls multiple squares and exerts pressure on the opponent's position.
          </p>
          <p>
            A centralized queen can quickly switch between attacking and defending, making it a versatile piece in both
            the middlegame and endgame.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="space-y-4" data-tactic="pins">
          <p>
            A <span class="font-bold">pin</span> is a tactical motif where a piece is immobilized because moving it
            would expose a more valuable piece behind it.
          </p>
          <p>
            This tactic is particularly effective against pieces that are pinned to the king, as any attempt to move
            the pinned piece would expose the king to check.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="space-y-4" data-tactic="skewers">
          <p>
            A <span class="font-bold">skewer</span>, similar to a pin, is a tactic where a more valuable piece is in
            front of an undefended, less valuable piece; like a reverse pin.
          </p>
          <p>
            The more valuable piece is forced to move to avoid being captured, rendering the piece behind it vulnerable
            ready for capture on the next move.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="space-y-4" data-tactic="forks">
          <p>
            A <span class="font-bold">fork</span> is a tactic which involves attacking two undefended or higher valued
            pieces at the same time, forcing the opponent to make a tough decision.
          </p>
          <p>
            The opponent can only save one of the pieces, at the expense of the other. On the next move, whichever piece
            was left undefended will be captured.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="space-y-4" data-tactic="batteries">
          <p>
            A <span class="font-bold">battery</span> is a formation of heavy pieces which line up on the same file or
            rank, providing a powerful attacking force.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the queen, a battery can be combined with other tactics, like forks, to create even more powerful
            threats.
