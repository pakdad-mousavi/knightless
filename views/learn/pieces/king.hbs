          The king is the most important piece in chess, as its capture results in a loss. It can move one square in
          any direction, making it a versatile but limited piece. The king is the heart of the game, and its safety is
          highly prioritized.
        </p>
        <p>
          The king is most effective when it is protected and not exposed to threats. Players must be cautious about
          the king's safety, especially during the opening and middlegame phases, to avoid getting checkmated.

          How It Moves

          The king moves one square in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This limited range makes
          the king a vulnerable piece, especially in the opening and middlegame.
        </p>
        <p>
          The king cannot move into check, meaning it must always stay out of reach of enemy pieces. This restriction
          adds to the king's vulnerability, as it often needs protection from other pieces.

          Common Tactics

          <p>
            <span class="font-bold">Castling</span> is a single, defensive move which is used to move the king out of
            the center of the board, while bringing the rook into the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            It can only be done by the king, if the king and rook have not moved, and there are no pieces with line of
            sight in the path of the castle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Castling is the only move in the game which allows a player to move two pieces during one move!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="space-y-4" data-tactic="forks">
          <p>
            A <span class="font-bold">fork</span> is a tactic which involves attacking two undefended or higher valued
            pieces at the same time, forcing the opponent to make a tough decision.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although rare, the king can actually fork pieces (except the king and queen) if placed correctly!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="space-y-4" data-tactic="opposition">
          <p>
            In endgames, <span class="font-bold">opposition</span> refers to the position where two kings stand on the
            same rank, file, or diagonal with an odd number of squares between them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The player who moves their king into opposition can control key squares and limit the movement of the
            opposing king. This is because the opposing king cannot move into the squares controlled by the
            player's king without putting itself in check.
