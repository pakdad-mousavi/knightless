          The Knight

          The knight moves in an “L” shape, two squares in one direction, then one square sideways. This unusual move
          makes it tricky and unpredictable. It's also the only piece that can jump over others, which allows it to
          strike from unexpected places, making it great for surprising attacks and breaking through defenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knights are strongest in the center, where they control more spaces. Mastering the knight helps you set traps
          and win material with clever forks!

          The knight moves uniquely in an L-shape pattern: it goes two squares in a straight line, either vertically or
          horizontally, and then turns to move one square either left or right, forming an L-shape pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
          It can <span class="font-bold">jump</span> over both its own and enemy pieces, making it a powerful tool for
          reaching unexpected squares.
        </p>
        <p>
          The knight is renown for its ability to attack multiple pieces at once, forcing the opponent to make a
          difficult choice. No other piece moves like the knight!

        <p>
          A <span class="font-bold">fork</span> is a tactical move where the knight attacks two or more enemy pieces
          simultaneously in a single turn, often forcing the opponent into a difficult decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to its unique L-shaped jumping pattern, the knight can effortlessly strike two or more different types of
          enemy pieces from surprising and hard-to-predict angles on the board.
